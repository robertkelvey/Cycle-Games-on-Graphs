# Cycle Games on Graphs

Computer code for playing the combinatorial games <i>Make-A-Cycle</i> (MAC) and <i>Avoid-A-Cycle</i> (AAC). These games were first defined for Cayley graphs in the paper <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110755411-011">Relator Games on Groups</a>. A second paper discussing the games MAC and AAC is forthcoming (put pre-print link here when ready).

## Compiling on a MacBook/Apple Machine

Download the folder <b>Cycle Games on Graphs</b>. You want to compile the file <tt>Source.cpp</tt>. If you do not have a C++ compiler installed, you'll need to get one. 

Include instructions on how to do this here? Or should we update the project with a compiled executable file for both MAC and Windows??
